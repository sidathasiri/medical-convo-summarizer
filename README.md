## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- AWS CDK CLI installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure AWS credentials

4. Configurations
     - Update the AWS account id, region and Cognito pool id in `bin/medical-convo-summarizer.ts`. You can find the Cognito pool ID after deploying the `https://github.com/sidathasiri/medical-convo-summarizer-web` project.
     - Update the `FROM_EMAIL_ADDRESS` in `lib/medical-convo-summarizer-stack.ts`. This is the email that you would use to send emails
     - Ensure the email addresses that you would use to send/receive are updated in SES as verified email addresses (if in SES sandbox mode)
     - Update the `bucketName` in `lib/medical-convo-summarizer-stack.ts`. This must be globally unique in S3.
     - Ensure you have access to the Nova Pro (`amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`) model in Bedrock

5. Deploy the stack:
   ```bash
   npx cdk deploy
   ```
